The following are my thoughts as I go through the features and their importance in predicting the thoughts of a home sale. 

- MSSubClass could be included, but YearBuilt replaces this
- Zoning is important, particularly Residential zoning
- LotFrontage (feet of street connected) maybe wont be important, or connected with Zoning
- LotArea is important 
- Street not so much
- Alley not so much
- Lot Shape not so much
- LandContour not so much
- Utilities maybe (only AllPub-->hot coded?)
- LotConfig maybe (only Cul-de-sac)?
- Landslope not so much
- Neighborhood is important (this could cover neighboring home values)
- Conidtion1/2 important
- BldgType is important
- HouseStyle is important 
- OverallQual is important 
- OverallCond is important 
- YearBuilt is important and is better than MSSubClass
- YearRemodAdd is important
- RoofStyle may not be 
- RoofMatl may not be 
- Exterior1st may not be
- Exterior2nd may not be 
- MassVnrType may not be 
- ExterQual--> this could be made numerical
- ExterCond --> this could be made numerical
    -- maybe make a 'Exterior' vector and take the magnitude of it to compare
- Foundation
- BmstQual --> make numerical
- BsmtCond --> make numerical
- BsmtExposure I think Good exposure is outside access, minimum exposure is natural light access
- BsmtFinType1 --> make numerical
- BsmtFinSF1 is important
- BsmtFinType2 --> make numerical
- BsmtFinSF2 is important
- BsmtUnfSF is important
- TotalBsmtSF is important
    -- Can we engineer some 'basement score'? Maybe the magnitude. Its almost like we should look at the difference of finished basement to unfinished basement and use that. 
- Heating is important 
- HeatingQC --> make numerical
- CentralAir (hot-coded)
- 1stFlrSF is important 
- 2ndFlrSF is important 
- LowQualFinSF is important (the more the less value it adds)
- GrLivArea is important 
- BsmtFullBath is important
- BsmtHalfBath is important
- FullBath is important
- HalfBath is important
- Bedroom is important
- Kitchen is important
- KitchenQual --> make numerical
- TotRmsAbovGrd is important
- Functional --> make numerical (seems extremely important)
- Fireplaces is important
- FireplaceQu is important
- GarageType --> make numerical
- GarageYrBuilt 
- GarageFinish is important
- GarageCars is important
- GarageArea is important 
- GarageQual --> make numerical
- GarageCond --> make numerical
    --similar to basement, make a Garage vector
- WoodDeckSF maybe?
- OpenPorch maybe?
- EnclosedPorch maybe?
- 3SsnPorch maybe?
- ScreenPorch maybe? 
- PoolArea: can be important
- PoolQC --> make numerical
- Fence --> make numerical
- MiscFeature is not important
- MiscVal is important 
- MoSold can be important? like summer months are more popular? 
- YrSold years with lower interests rates would have an impact on home sale
- SaleType is important --> make numerical
-SaleCOndition --> make numerical
